# Vanilla Javascript Rock Paper Scissors game

<br>

This is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game written entirely in pure Javascript, HTML and CSS_



## Summary

It took me more than a week to work through building out all the functionality that was needed. I learned A TON about problem solving and some of the different concepts I had learned in Javascript (such as working with Objects). It was challenging at times but worth every minute. :).
